                    <p class="content">The Bible is full of exhortations for us to pray: “Everything by prayer! Praying always! Men ought always to pray! Pray always! Pray without ceasing!” 
                        In this remarkable book, “Everything by prayer, nothing without prayer”, you will embark on a journey that will teach you the ways and patterns in the prayer life of Jesus Christ. If Jesus prayed, you and I ought to pray more. Everything in our lives can be achieved by prayer and nothing can be achieved without prayer. 
                       Your prayer life will be exciting after this riveting read!</p>
